	<h1 align="center"> As a student who loves to create a short story by script writing it develops my writing skills,
	I often find myself weaving stories that not only entertain but also reflect real-life experiences and emotions like mine.
	Script writing has become more than just a skill for me— it’s my outlet, my passion, and my way of connecting with people.
	Whether it's for a school play, a short film project, or a spoken poetry piece, I always aim to give voice to stories that matter.
